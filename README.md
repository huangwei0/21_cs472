Catalog Description: Computer architecture using processors, memories, and I/O devices as building blocks. Issues involved in the design of instruction set architecture, processor, pipelining and memory organization. Design philosophies and trade-offs involved in Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architectures.

Course content
-Performance measurements
-Instruction set design
-Computer arithmetic
-Processor: data path and control design, pipeline design, memory system, I / O design, parallel systems
Student Learning Objectives
-Use various metrics to calculate the performance of a computer system
-Identify the addressing mode of instructions
-Determine which hardware blocks and control lines are used for specific instructions
-Analyze clock periods, performance, and instruction throughput of single-cycle, multi-cycle, and pipelined implementations of a simple instruction set
-Detect pipeline hazards and identify possible solutions to those hazards
-Show how cache design parameters affect cache hit rate
-Map a virtual address into a physical address
-Demonstrate how parallel programming and multi-core architectures can benefit/degrade system performance, depending on software applications.
-CS/ECE572: Explore processor performance-cost trade-off quantitatively in a detailed simulator
General Information
-Students enrolled in ECE572 or CS572 should expect additional assignments or alternative exams to test for proficiency.
-I attempt to answer all emails within 48 hours (excluding weekends). I often respond much faster.
-Remember to use your TAs because they are the ones who execute, read, and grade the assignments.
-Normally I ask that cell phones and other mobile devices should be silenced and away during lecture. Due to the "remote delivery" format of this class, I realize that students don't always have a silent area in which to work. However, please try to be courteous to the instructor and other students in the Zoom classroom. If you are not intending to speak, keep your microphone muted to reduce background noise.
